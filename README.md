# Applied Data Science with Python: IMDB Software for Hollywood Actors and Actresses

## Summary

Our recent project, undertaken at Ostbayerische Technische Hochschule Regensburg, involved developing a comprehensive software application focused on Hollywood actors and actresses using data science techniques and Python. The goal was to create an intuitive platform to store, retrieve, and display detailed information on the top 50 popular actors and actresses from IMDb, including their filmography, awards, and ratings. The project was guided by Istvan Lengyel and contributed by Nguyễn Quốc Minh Thư.

## Skills and Technologies Used

### Data Science
- **Data scraping**: Beautiful Soup
- **Data processing and manipulation**
- **Data storage and retrieval**: Relational databases

### Programming
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript (React.js)
- **Frameworks**: Django (Backend), React.js (Frontend)
- **Database**: SQL (PostgreSQL)

### Web Development
- **Frontend**: React.js, Bulma library for UI components
- **Backend**: Django framework
- **API Development and Testing**: Postman

### Algorithms and Problem-Solving
- **Data parsing and extraction algorithms**
- **Sequence and system modeling diagrams**
- **Relational data structure design**

### Tools and Libraries
- **Web scraping**: Requests and Beautiful Soup
- **Database interactions**: Django ORM
- **User interfaces**: React.js

## Project Highlights

- **Core Functionality**: Developed a platform to store, retrieve, and display information on actors and actresses, including filmography, awards, and ratings.
- **Data Science Techniques**: Utilized data scraping, processing, and storage methods to manage large datasets.
- **User-Centric Design**: Focused on creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface to enhance user experience.
- **Web Development**: Implemented a robust backend with Django and an interactive frontend with React.js.

This project not only reinforced our technical skills in data science and web development but also highlighted the importance of effective data management and user-centric design. Our software aims to enhance the user experience by providing comprehensive and easily accessible information about Hollywood’s favorite stars.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
