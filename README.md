# Introduction to Cloud Computing: Weather Report Application on AWS

## Summary

In our recent project at Ostbayerische Technische Hochschule Regensburg, we developed a cloud-based weather report application leveraging AWS services. This project aimed to create a user-friendly web interface that allows users to retrieve and display weather data for various locations, using services such as OpenWeatherMap. The project was supervised by Maximilian Schön and contributed by Nguyễn Quốc Minh Thư.

## Skills and Technologies Used

### Cloud Computing
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless backend functions
- **AWS DynamoDB**: NoSQL database management
- **AWS API Gateway**: Creating and managing APIs
- **AWS IAM**: Secure access management

### Web Development
- **Frontend**: React.js with Bulma CSS framework
- **Backend**: Python functions on AWS Lambda
- **Hosting**: AWS Amplify for static web hosting

### Data Integration
- **API Integration**: OpenWeatherMap for real-time weather data retrieval
- **Data Storage**: AWS DynamoDB for storing and retrieving weather data

### Additional Features
- **Voice Recognition**: Optional integration with Alexa for spoken user input
- **Version Control and Deployment**: Using GitHub and AWS Amplify

## Project Highlights

- **User-friendly Interface**: Developed a simple and intuitive web frontend to input locations and display current and forecasted weather information.
- **Cloud-based Solution**: Implemented a full-stack architecture using AWS services to ensure scalability, reliability, and security.
- **Data Storage**: Enabled storage of current and historical weather data in a DynamoDB NoSQL database, allowing users to access previous weather information.
- **Serverless Architecture**: Utilized AWS Lambda for efficient and scalable backend processing without managing server infrastructure.

This project enhanced our understanding of cloud computing principles, serverless architecture, and full-stack web development. It provided practical experience in integrating various AWS services to build a scalable and reliable cloud-based application.

I am excited to apply the knowledge and skills gained from this project to future endeavors in the field of cloud computing and web development.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
